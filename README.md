# Scrap Facebook group's info
Python script that scraps online informations about a facebook group : the number of members and the number of new posts today. 

Working on November 2019.

## About 

This project used to be a Page Jaune's reverse scraper. By providing a list of phone numbers, you'd get the corresponding companies using this number on Page Jaune (the French Yellow pages, a telephone directory of business). It was used to further verify correctness of phone lists in business. 

This previous script, made with `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup`, worked well in Summer 2018. But since, the Page Jaune website has improved its security, and the script has sadly become unusable. I thus repurposed it with a different use case.
